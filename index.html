                    <h3 class="question">1. Choose one of the data sets listed above in the Activity section or one that you find on your own and give a brief description of it. What specifically were the types of data (text, sounds, transactions, etc.) included in the data set you chose? </h2>
                    <p class="answer"> Within the data set found in reddit's thread r/dataisbeautiful, within this thread contains many data sets that are uploaded by the users of reddit demonstrating trends with a broad spectre of content, from timlines of average color of frams of 2020 Academy Award contenders, to a graph that displays the european covid-19 infection timeline. The types of data included, transitions of a subject over time through the use of graphs, maps, images, spreadsheets, etc. Can be found here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/top/" target="_blank"> r/DataIsBeatiful </a></p>
                    <h3 class="question">2. What new facts did you learn when exploring the data set? List at least 3 facts. </h2>
                    <p class="answer"> From the three things that I learned while exploring the data sets within reddit, one thing I learned is that the keyword "coronavirus" is the most searched word on twitter, another thing I learned is that what women want is mutual attraction or love from their lover, when women were asked to evaluate 18 factors in choosing a mate. The third thing I learned is that these data sets are affected by major events/ situations as the most common datasets I see when I explore through the page is that of the coronavirus, giving data on the rate of infection or amount of people infected with the virus throughout different locations around the world.</p>
                    <h3 class="question">3. Write a question you have about the data set you chose. Now, convert that question into a hypothesis (a statement) with your prediction about the data. </h2>
                    <p class="answer"> Question: "How many reddit users actually participate on peoples uploads by commenting or uploading their own content?" <br> Hypothesis: The majority of reddit users will most likely not participate or interact with reddit through uploading content or commenting on other users posts. Data set: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/b5f9wi/lets_hear_it_for_the_lurkers_the_vast_majority_of/" target="_blank"> Reddit User Participation </a></p>
                    <h3 class="question">4. Identify at least one security and/or privacy concern that is associated with the data in the data set you chose? </h2>
                    <p class="answer"> One privacy concern can relate to companies using user's data who have commented or uploaded content for their own profit or to use against you.  </p>
                    <h3 class="question">5. If your data set included a visualization, explain the purpose of the visualization. How would you change or improve the visualization? If it did not include a visualization, describe one that you think would be useful in understanding the data. </h2>
                    <p class="answer"> The data set included a pie chart with the use of legends, a header, and footnote. The purpose of this visulization is to demonstrate the users who actually comment or post to those that are lurkers, or people who only view uploads and do not participate in uploading or providing feedback to uploaders. Overall the visualization covers everything needed for data, the only thing I would change is the way it looks.</p>

                        <p class="answer"> Another example for an AI is a robotic spike that detects tomates from a salad and attempt to remove the tomates from the salad. Seperating tomates is a relatively easy task for humans but it takes a lot of effort and energy to move and sort through a salad bowl for every tomato. For a computer it is harder to find tomatoes buried under lettuces as it no longer would be visible to be detected.
